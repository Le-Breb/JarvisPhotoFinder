# On-going Tasks
- [ ] 🔴 ⚡️ Optimize the upload of images. (@Breb)
# Backlog
- [ ] 🔴 : 🎨 Clean the python code and the back-end code of the project. 
- [ ] 🔴 : 📝 Define the scope of the product, what we want to do with it (either global search engine, music, ect ..., focus on photo/video, may be detection of events in photo, video). 
- [ ] 🟡 : 🔧 Change the path system to be centralized + allow nested folders inside image folder.
- [ ] 🟡 : 🔒️ Secure the account system, see how it works and make it the most secure possible.
- [ ] 🟡 : ✨ Add distant loading of the website.
- [ ] 🟡 : 🎨 Make a clear distinction between the client and the server, both should be able to start with one line command. 
- [ ] 🟡 : ✨ The client should be available everywhere, Mobile, Computer.
- [ ] 🟡 : 👱 Add support for searching for multiple people at the same time.
- [ ] 🟡 : 📁 Add a file browser (+move upload there ?)
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Create a way to separate event and make a way to go through images by event, the clustering should be with all the data possible (date, CLIP, faces, tags, camera info)
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Improve the labeling system, having at the end the most efficient way to label. (Change both of the model should be considered).
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Handle the classification of videos by extracting some images and making the embeddings on that.
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Smooth handling of adding embeddings, load bar and embedding progression kept even if shutdown during the process.
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Create video based on event, cluster, making suggestion based on cluster but also make video with prompt (Very complicated, LLM cannot run anywhere lol)
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Evaluate which features are wanted, not everybody want to see graphs !
- [ ] 🟢 : ✨ Fix name search so that nested names are handled correctly
- [ ] ⚪ : ✨ Create a video with the photo of a person during all of his life.
- [ ] ⚪ : ✨ Create a downstream model to combine face recognition and CLIP model.
# Done
- [x] ✨ Vibe coded an app to do an MVP (@Claude)

# OKRs (Yes we are very assertif here)
- [ ] 🎯 Create a first usable version of the product to get feedback from close users. (By end of yesterday.)

# Questions (There is no dumb question only dumb answers 🐘)
- Can LLM run locally on any hardware to create videos.
